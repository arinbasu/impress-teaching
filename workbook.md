What is the health hazard we want to investigate?

# Exposure assessment {.step data-x="1000" data-y="-500" data-rotate=90}

Assess how much are people exposed to

# Dose response assessment {.step data-x="1000" data-y = "0"}

Assess the pattern of exposure to the toxin with the extent of the health effects that accrue

# Risk characterisation {.step data-x="0" data-y="0"}

Combine the above information to state the extent of the risk
